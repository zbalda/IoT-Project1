# Step 1: Setup

For our implementation we used Java with the Pi4J library.

#### How to Install Pi4J

`apt install pi4j`

#### How to Run with Pi4J
`javac -classpath .:classes:/opt/pi4j/lib/'*' StepX.java`

`sudo java -classpath .:classes:/opt/pi4j/lib/'*' StepX`

#### Challenges

After installing Pi4J we encountered a conflict between the Pi4J library and our Raspberry Pi kernel version. We resolved this issue by installing a Pi4J snapshot that did not conflict with our kernel version:

`sudo dpkg -i pi4j-1.2-SNAPSHOT.deb`
